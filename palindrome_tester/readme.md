A PHP app that allows users to test if a word or phrase is a palindrome. It also
tells the user if the word is a standard palindrome or a perfect palindrome.

Instructions
1. Open the index.php in a browser.

2. Enter a word or phrase in the input field.

3. Click the "Submit" button. An error message should occur if the input was empty.

4. The results will tell the user whether the input is or is not a standard palindrome
(which ignores spaces and punctuation) or a perfect palindrome (which takes spaces and punctuation into account).

5. Click the "Reset" button to clear the input.
