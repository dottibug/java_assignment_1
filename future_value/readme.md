Future Value Calculator

PHP app that calculates the future value of an investment.
Users can enter an initial amount, interest rate, and a number of years to compound interest.
A checkbox also allows the user to compound interest monthly.

Instructions
1. Open the index.php in a browser.

2. Enter an investment amount, yearly interest rate, and number of years.
The inputs should only allow valid numbers greater than 0. The max interest rate allowed is 15,
and years must be a whole number less than 31.

3. Leave "Compound Monthly" unchecked and click "Calculate" to see the results.

4. Keeping the same inputs, click "Compound Monthly" to see the updated future value.
The message indicating how interest was compounded should also update to reflect monthly instead of yearly.
